sed = string editor
		using sed we can modify the file content without opening using any of vi command.
how to print particular line
	eg : want to print line 8
		sed -n 8p file2

What does awk command do?
The awk command is a Linux tool and programming language that allows users to process and manipulate data and produce formatted reports.

what is the use of grep command?
	using grep we can search word(string) in file or files in one particular location.

find is for search file/directory with many options.
	we can search file with name
	we can search file with size if we remember file size or directory size
	we can search file with owner if we remember file owner or directory owner
	we can search with inode number if we rember file inode number of directory inode number
	we can search with date and time also if we remeber when we created 
	we can search with permissions if we remember file or directory permissions

		-name
		-size
		-user
		-inum
		-mtime
		-perm


	find / -name b26file1

	find <path> <-name is clue> <fullfiling the clue>

size:
	find / -size +1G
		to seach files with greater than 1 GB

	how to search files with size between 1 GB to 5 GB
		find / -size +1G -size -5G
			between

perm:
	find / -perm 700

***** how to search empty files?
	find / -empty
		or
	find / -size 0
		if need to search only empty files
	find / -type f -size 0
		f means files
		d directories

	find empty files in /app3 and remove them

	find /app3 -type f -size 0 -exec rm -rf {} \;

	-exec rm -rf {} \;
	-exec mv {} / \;

how to search files or directories with inode number?
		find / -inum <inodenumber>

how to find out older files which are created/modified older than 30 days

	finding old logs and deleting 
	finding older than 30 days logs and move or delete those data

	-mtime modify time
	find /var -type f -mtime +30
		above command is for find out only files with older than 30 days modification days
		find /var/log -type f -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} \; 
find older than 90 days data from so and so location and delete those or move those.
	find /var/log -type f -mtime +90 -exec rm -rf {} \;
older than 2 days	
	-mtime +2
find out older than 10 min modified or created files
       -mmin
	find /app3 -mmin -5 
	finding out files/dir which are created or modified with in 5 min (-mmin -5)

more and less commands

	more: is for view the file content with page by page
	less : is for view the file content with page by page
eg: there is lenghthy file like 100 pages file. requirement is need to read 100 pages file page by page
        then we can use more or less commands to read the file content
		more filename
		less filename

	more /var/log/messages
		next page   	space bar
		previous page    	b
		line by line	enter key in key board
				q for quit
	less /var/log/messages
		next page   	space bar
		previous page    	b
		line by line	enter key in key board
				q for quit

difference is search the word is very easy in less compare to more.

which has more features?
	less command

	
head and tail commands:


Head: we can view the first 10 lines of the file
tail: we can view the last 10 lines of the file

	head filename
	tail filename
	
particular lines
	head -5 filename
	tail -6 filename



redirection the file output to another new file:
		cat -n file1 > /file2

	first command cat -n file1  ===> to view the file1 content with line numbers
	second command > /file2 ===> redirect first command output to new file

***** how to print between lines?
	eg : i want to print line 10 to line 20
	
	head -20 file2 | tail -10

	|  symbol = can store the previous command output and pass that output to next command as a input
	
		previous command output will store in | symbol
	head -20 file2 output stored in |  now in | symbol first 20 lines are there. is this correct
	tail -10 from | symbol
		second command is depending on pipe symbol output

	head -20 file2 | tail -10 | head -5 | head -1

***** how to print particular line
	eg : want to print line 8
		sed -n 8p file2

	sed = string editor
		using sed we can modify the file content without opening using any of vi command.

how to kill process?
		kill pid
		pkill processname

how to check server performance?
	1. top
	using top we can verify the server performance, here we can see live data
	what process is consuming how much RAM and How much cpu %.
	2. SAR
		using sar also we can analyze live and historical like yesterday how was the memory utilization over all 
		not possible to get individual process utilization in sar

disk utilization : storage capacity ( df -h) 
The df command displays the amount of disk space available on the filesystem with each file name's argument.

mount command is used to mount the filesystem found on a device to big tree structure(Linux filesystem) rooted at ‘/‘. 

The Netcat ( nc ) command is a command-line utility for reading and writing data between two computer networks.

SSH = using ssh we can transfer files/directories and remote administration can posible in secure maner.
